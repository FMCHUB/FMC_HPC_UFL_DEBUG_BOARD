## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly & Usage Notes

- Board exceeds FMC single-width outline ‚Üí check mechanical clearance in your setup.
- Use spacers or standoffs to prevent mechanical stress.
- For JTAG/I¬≤C use, solder standard 2.54‚ÄØmm pin headers to breakout pads.
- SMA and U.FL connectors are intended for signal probing. Ensure correct termination.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- **Incorrect loopback or interconnects can damage connected hardware**. Always verify voltage levels and signal directions before making U.FL cable connections.
- Clamp connectors are suitable for low-frequency probing only.
